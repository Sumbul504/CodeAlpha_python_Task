# CodeAlpha Python Internship Tasks

This repository contains the Python tasks I completed during my internship at CodeAlpha.  
All tasks are implemented in Python and organized in a single Google Colab notebook with clear headings for each task.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Hangman Game
A text-based Hangman game where the user guesses letters to complete a hidden word.  
The game is built using basic Python concepts such as loops, lists, and conditional statements, and uses ASCII characters to represent the hangman.

### Task 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
This project simulates a simple stock portfolio system.  
Users can add stocks, enter quantities, check and update stock prices, and view the total value of their portfolio.  
It demonstrates the use of dictionaries, user input handling, and basic calculations.

### Task 4: Rule-Based Chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined keywords.  
The chatbot demonstrates conditional logic and basic text processing to simulate a conversation.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. Follow the instructions displayed for each task.

## Additional Notes
- All projects are console-based and do not use any graphical interface.
- The chatbot follows simple predefined rules and is intended for learning purposes.
- Sample data is used where applicable to demonstrate functionality.
